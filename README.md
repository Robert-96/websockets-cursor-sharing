# websockets-cursor-sharing

> An interactive web application that shares cursor positions in real-time, created using WebSockets and Node.js.

This demo application is designed to generate a distinct colored cursor icon for each user who is connected to the application. As a user moves their mouse, their cursor icon moves on their own screen and on the screen of every other connected user. The movement of the cursor icon is updated in real-time as the user moves their mouse.

## Running this Demo

```bash
> npm install
> npm run start
```
